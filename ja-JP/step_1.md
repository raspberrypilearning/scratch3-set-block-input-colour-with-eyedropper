Some blocks in Scratch allow you to choose a colour.

```blocks3
<touching color (#20f73b) ?>

<color (#819322) is touching (#5fe98e) ?>

set pen color to (#e50820)
```

You can choose a colour to match a colour that appears on the Stage.

Click on the colour input to open the colour picker and then click on the eyedropper at the bottom.

Move the mouse pointer over to the Stage and move around until you have selected the colour you want and then click (or tap) to select the colour.

The colour in the block input will change to match the colour you chose. Click in the Code area to close the colour picker.
